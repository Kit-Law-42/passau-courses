# Passau-courses
This repository act as storage and reference for all University of Passau coursework/projects involved in 2020-2021.

## CourseList
3 courses with coding exercises are involved by now. They are:
- Programming Styles 5842 (Java & Node.js)
- Scaling Databases 5970 (Python & Hadoop)
- Data Science Lab 5944 (Python & Tensorflow)

Please see below for abstracts for each course.

### 1) Programming Style
In this course, I work with a classic minesweeper problem which is described in [Program description](https://github.com/se2p/ps-wise-2021-program-description).
Served as a course in programming sub-module, coding same problem in different programming styles remains an interesting course to me as a former web programmer.
I aim to solid my skills in java and node.js, and familiar with test cases writing for both of them. 
A total of 10 styles with be implemented by the end of March.

### 2) Scaling Databases
In this course, I work with SQL statement, parse them into relational algebra and select items from json file.
Implementation of this pipeline is by `radb` and `luigi` library in python 3.8.
Enhancement of hadoop loading speed is also included in this exercise. Please see python file for further details.


### 3) Data Science Lab (GAN Training)
In this project, we have a dataset of brain tumors images. These images are Brain MRI images of 256 X 256 pixel size with 3 channels per image (pre-contrast, FLAIR and post-contrast,inthis order of channels) together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)lower-grade glioma collection. They correspond to 110 patients who had preoperative imaging data available. 

We are planning to use address two questions in this project:
- **GAN Selection**: Which GAN architecture is well suited for re-alistic medical image generation, especially for MRI images?
- **CNN Image classifier**: Can synthetic images of MRI scan im-prove accuracy of Medical Image classifier?

This project is finished and dis-continued on Mar 2021.
